title: "Introduction"

Over the course of this 1-day workshop you will learn the basics of the
[R](https://www.r-project.org/)-programming language and
how to use R (and related software) for data analysis, graphics, and reproducible research.
Throughout the workshop, I encourage you to ask questions and get help from those around you.

### Packages

Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format.









## Pros and cons of R

Pros include:

* It is free and open-source software that is available for most operating systems
  (such as Windows, OS X, and Linux).

* Because your work is stored in scripts, and the software is freely available, anyone can easily replicate it.
  This is often not the case for GUI-driven workflows, such as those relying on Excel or ArcGIS.

* It is extensible and offers robust tools for developers to build their own packages,
  these are collections of functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format.
  There are over ten-thousand packages available for download that address almost all of your data science needs,
  everything from statistical modelling to machine learning.

* Immediate access to the very latest statistical techniques and implementations.

* An extremely active community dedicated to helping each other.
  There are a variety of forums for asking questions, such as the
  [R mailing lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html) and
  [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

* Provides tools for communicating your research using dynamic
  [report](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and
  [website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) generation.

* Designed to connect to other programming languages such as
  C, Fortran, C++, SQL, and tcl/tk.

* Includes many functions that can be used for reading, visualizing, and analyzing
  geographical [spatial data](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Spatial).

Cons include:

* Scientists without programming experience are often frustrated by R's steep learning curve.
  It can be difficult to remember R syntax and function names,
  especially if you don't code on a regular basis.

* The quality of contributed packages can vary from abysmal to superb.
  Therefore, determining which package to apply to a given problem can be a little overwhelming.

* R is not a high-performance programming language like C and Fortran,
  and it's not uncommon to run into memory limitations.
  These issues are partly attriubted to poorly written R code.
