Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled by typing the following command
(edit name, for example, "Jason Fisher"):

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"
```

Tell Git the *email address* that will be associated with your Git commits.

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
```
