Git is an open source version control system (VCS).

## Set Up Git

Startup the **Git Bash** application.

Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled by typing the following command
(for example, replace `"<YOUR NAME>"` with `"Jason Fisher"`):

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"
```

Tell Git the *email address* that will be associated with your *git commits*.
(for example, replace `<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>` with `jfisher@usgs.gov`):

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
```

## Create a Local Repository

Let's assume you have an existing working directory (such as "repo-example")
that contains files and folders.
Again startup **Git Bash**, but this time open the application through File Explorer
by right clicking the folder of interest and selecting *Git Bash Here*.
To create the git repository, use the following command:

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git init
```
Notice that a `.git` file was written to your working directory.
This file stores the future history of any edits made to file content in the repository.

There is, however, an additional command need to start tracking changes.
Files must be added to the repository in order for them to be tracked.
The following command tells git to start tracking all files within your repository.

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git add .
```

Any future files that may be added to your working directory need to be added.
For example, if you want to add a single text file located in
"repo-example/test/file.txt", use

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git add repo-example/test/file2.txt
```
The `status` command can be used to check the current state of your repository.

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git state
```

At what seems like a good stopping point in your workflow,
say after completing some interesting function in R.
Commit all your changes using the following command and leave
a message to help you find these changes in the future.
To commit changes, use:

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

## Set Up Remote Repository

Now that the files are committed, set up your remote repository.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is probably the most popular git repository hosting service out there.
And the USGS has a presence on GitHub, see its organization page at https://github.com/usgs/.

Sign up for a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/join):

1. The account name will be in the following format: "AD shortname"-usgs.
   Example: jfisher-usgs.
   If you have a special character such as an underscore in your username,
   replace it with a dash.

2. The account will use the user's official USGS email address.

3. The account will use the user's real name.

4. This password should not be used for any other account.

Notify the "gs_github_admin@usgs.gov" email group of your new username,
and they will add you to the list of users on https://github.com/usgs/,
and add you to the "gs_github@usgs.gov" email discussion and announcements group.

Once we add you to the USGS org (https://github.com/usgs),
click the "publicize" option in your account settings.
Once you do this, GitHub will publicly list you as a member of the USGS organization.

### Create a repository on GitHub

In the upper-right corner of any of your GitHub pages,
click **+**, and then click *New repository*.

Create a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "repo-example".
Leave everything else with default values, and click the Create repository button.

Head back over to your **Git Bash** and establish a connection to the GitHub repository,
use the following commands (and change URL as needed):

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git remote add origin https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/repo-example.git
git push -u origin master
```

From here on out, all that is need to push your commits to your online repository is

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
git push
```

#### Exercise

1. Initiate your own repsitory, you can use "repo-example" as a starting point.

2. Add and commit your file content to your new local repository.

3. Sign-up for a GitHub account and create a new remote repository.

4. Establish a connection between your local and remote repository.

5. Push commits to GitHub.

6. Make changes to file content locally.

7. Repeat steps 2 and 5.

5. Can you find a graphical reprentation of your commits on GitHub.
