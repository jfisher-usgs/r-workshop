title: "Software"
---

Prior to the start of the workshop everyone bringing a computer will need to have had the software installed and tested.
Below are the instructions for installing software used in this workshop.
If you do not have install access to your computer,
you will need to contact your IT representative to have them install it.
You can give them a link to this page for instructions.
These instructions are for installing software on a Windows 7 (or higher) operating system (OS).

## R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and software environment
for statistical computing and graphics.
[Download](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) the latest binary distribution of R
from the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN).
Once the installer downloads, double left-click the installation file.
Accept default options on all but the following dialogs.

Set the location for the R installation to someplace you have write access, such as your "Documents" folder.
This may already be the default if you're installing as a standard user, without administrative privileges.

Customize startup options by specifying *Yes (customized startup)*.

Set the R graphical user interface to operate with multiple top-level windows for the console,
graphics and pager, by specifying *SDI (separate windows)*.

| ![](images/software-r_03.png)

Once installed, R should be accessible from the start menu or desktop shortcut.
Assuming you installed R on a 64-bit OS, two versions of R are made available, that is, a 32-bit and 64-bit version.
The 64-bit version of R (R x64) is preferred.
Startup an R session.
Once running the R Console should look something like this

R comes with a standard set of packages,
these are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format.
Other user-contributed packages are available for download and installation.
Install the following packages available from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/)
by pasting the following code in the R console and pressing Enter.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("inlmisc", "dataRetrieval", "lattice", "ggplot2", "colorspace",
                   "viridis", "animation", "sfsmisc", "devtools", "roxygen2",
                   "knitr", "xtable", "git2r", "rmarkdown"))
```

## Notepad++

If you don't already have a favorite text editor
(Notepad and Wordpad don't count, [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/) does),
[download](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/) the latest 32-bit version of
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
Once the installer downloads, right-click on it and select *Run as administrator*.
Accept default options on all dialogs.
Once installed, Notepad++ is accessible from Windows Explorer,
right-click on a text file (such as an R source file [*.R]) and select *Edit with Notepad++*.
Once running the file is opened in the text editor, it should look something like this

## RTools

<span style="color:red;">Optional</span>:
RTools is a collection of resources for building packages for R.
[Download](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) the latest "frozen" version of Rtools.
Once the installer downloads, right-click on it and select *Run as administrator*.
Accept default options on all but the following dialogs.

Select the additional task to edit the current value of the System Path.

| ![](images/software-rtools_01.png)

Confirm that "c:\\Rtools\\bin" and "c:\\Rtools\\gcc-4.6.3\\bin" (version number may differ)
are located at the beginning of the System Path.

| ![](images/software-rtools_02.png)

Once installed, check if Rtools can be accessed through R.
Close the current R session (assuming you have it open) and open a new R session.
Paste the following command into the R Console to see if Rtools is included in the System Path.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("PATH")
```

You should see "c:\\\\Rtools\\\\bin;c:\\\\Rtools\\\\gcc-4.6.3\\\\bin;..." in the output.

R functions that simplify common package development tasks are included in the
[devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package.

## MiKTeX

<span style="color:red;">Optional</span>:
[MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) is an implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows.

select the *Roots* tab, it should look something like this

| ![](images/software-miktex_03.png)

Push the *Add...* button and select the root directory for R's LaTeX supplementary files.
Your looking for the "texmf" folder within the R installation directory structure, mine is located here:
"C:\\Users\\jfisher\\Documents\\R\\R-3.3.1\\share\\texmf".

R functions that let you write LaTeX documents are included in the
[knitr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr) package.

## Texmaker

<span style="color:red;">Optional</span>:
[Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) is a tool for developing documents with LaTeX.

Select *Configure Texmaker* under the *Options* pull-down menu.
For better or worse Texmaker commands are configured using best guesses for default paths.
That is, no checks are made to ensure that these paths are correct.
The only path you need to concern yourself with is located in the *R Sweave* entry.
Check that the path to "R.exe" is correct, change as needed.
In addition, configure the *R Sweave* entry to use the **knitr** R package,
it should look something like this

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
"C:/Users/jfisher/Documents/R/R-3.3.1/bin/Rscript.exe" -e "knitr::knit('%.Rnw')"
```

Next, click on the *Quick Build* button located on the left-hand-side of the Configure Texmaker dialog
and specify to use the *PdfLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PdfLaTeX (x2) + View Pdf* command.

The basic workflow is to open an R Sweave document (\*.Rda) in Texmaker.
Select *R Sweave* under the *Tools* pull-down menu;
and if the process exits normally, press the *Quick Build* button to complete the conversion to a PDF document.
