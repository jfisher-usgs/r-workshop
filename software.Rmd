Prior to the start of the workshop everyone bringing a computer will need to have had the software installed and tested.
Below are the instructions for installing software used in this workshop.
If you do not have install access to your computer,
you will need to contact your IT representative to have them install it.
You can give them a link to this page for instructions.
These instructions are for installing software on a Windows operating system.

# R

Download the latest binary distribution of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
([CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/ "R for Windows")).
Once the installer downloads, double left-click the installation file.
Accept default options on all but the following dialogs.

Set the default location for the R installation to someplace you have write access, such as your Documents folder.
This may already be the default if you're not installing with administrator privileges.
